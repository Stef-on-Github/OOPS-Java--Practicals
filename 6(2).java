Certainly! Let's extend the previous example to demonstrate how to access a class from a package. I'll create a new file named `AccessPackage.java` outside the `mypackage`:

1. Create a new Java file named `AccessPackage.java`:

```java
// File: AccessPackage.java
import mypackage.MyClass;  // Import the MyClass from the mypackage

public class AccessPackage {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
        myObject.displayMessage();
    }
}
```

2. Compile the new file along with the existing files:

```bash
javac mypackage/MyClass.java
javac AccessPackage.java
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
java AccessPackage
```

In this example, we're importing `mypackage.MyClass` into the `AccessPackage` class. This demonstrates how to access a class from a package.

Make sure that the directory structure is maintained, and the package name in the `MyClass` file is declared correctly. When you compile and run the `AccessPackage` class, it should create an instance of `MyClass` and call the `displayMessage` method.
